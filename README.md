# Lets-Chat

A dynamic responsive chat application built with material ui, react, and nodejs. The project uses real-time, event-based communication between the browser and the server, with the help of the socket.io library. it also uses mongodb for database manaagement allowing some features like authentication, storing offline messages and so much more.

Status: 94% complete. Performing actions on nested queries in mongodb is a real pain.
